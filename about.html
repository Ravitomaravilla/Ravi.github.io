  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I am from India and currently pursuing my Master’s in Astrophysics at the University of Potsdam, Germany. Besides my academics, I enjoy playing football, chess, and going on bike rides. I also have a passion for languages — I’m fluent in English, speak Hindi and Telugu, and have been learning German. Beyond research, I aspire to engage in scientific outreach, as it has long been my dream to share the wonders of science in a fun, accessible, and inspiring way</p>
