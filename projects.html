    <h2>Blue Horizontal Branch (BHB) Stars</h2>
    <p>
      During my first real experience with scientific research and observations, I worked on a project focused on the 
      spectroscopic analysis of Blue Horizontal Branch (BHB) stars to investigate their evolutionary origin from 
      main-sequence stars without requiring stellar interactions. The aim was to acquire multi-epoch spectra of BHB 
      candidates in order to identify radial velocity variations caused by potential binary companions and to compare 
      binary frequencies with those of main-sequence populations. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This involved target selection using tools such as TOPCAT for catalog and target list creation, Simbad for object identification, and Stellarium for generating finding charts. Once observations were 
      obtained, I performed reduction and preliminary checks on the spectra, including line broadening analysis to study 
      stellar rotation and other broadening mechanisms, as well as SED fitting to determine stellar parameters. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I also explored the use of IRAF for data reduction and spectral analysis. This project not only deepened my 
      understanding of stellar astrophysics but also gave me hands-on exposure to observational planning, data reduction, 
      and interpretationâ€”an inspiring introduction to doing real science.

  <!-- Project 2: Classification of Galaxies -->
  <div class="about-page">
  <h2>Classification of Galaxies</h2>

  <p>
    This project focuses on the <strong>morphological classification of galaxies</strong> using 
    <strong>convolutional neural networks (CNNs)</strong>. The goal was to train a deep learning model capable 
    of distinguishing between <em>spiral</em> and <em>elliptical</em> galaxies. The dataset was obtained from 
    the <strong>Galaxy Zoo</strong> project, with FITS file extraction and data cleaning performed using 
    <strong>Astropy</strong> and <strong>Pandas</strong>, followed by filtering uncertain classifications and 
    downloading images via the <strong>SDSS API</strong> using the <strong>Requests</strong> library.
  </p>

  <p>
    I preprocessed and augmented the dataset, normalized the images, and trained a CNN using 
    <strong>TensorFlow</strong> and <strong>Keras</strong>. All images were standardized with 
    <strong>Pillow</strong> and <strong>NumPy</strong>, then organized into structured training and validation sets. 
    The model learned key morphological patterns such as <em>spiral arms</em> and <em>bulges</em>, achieving 
    approximately <strong>95% validation accuracy</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The final model demonstrated strong performance in predicting galaxy morphologies, 
    showcasing the power of <strong>machine learning in astrophysical data analysis</strong>.
