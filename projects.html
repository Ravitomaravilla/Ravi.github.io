    <h2>Blue Horizontal Branch (BHB) Stars</h2>
    <p>
      During my first real experience with scientific research and observations, I worked on a project focused on the 
      spectroscopic analysis of Blue Horizontal Branch (BHB) stars to investigate their evolutionary origin from 
      main-sequence stars without requiring stellar interactions. The aim was to acquire multi-epoch spectra of BHB 
      candidates in order to identify radial velocity variations caused by potential binary companions and to compare 
      binary frequencies with those of main-sequence populations. 
    </p>

      This involved target selection using tools such as TOPCAT for catalog and target list creation, Simbad for object identification, and Stellarium for generating finding charts. Once observations were 
      obtained, I performed reduction and preliminary checks on the spectra, including line broadening analysis to study 
      stellar rotation and other broadening mechanisms, as well as SED fitting to determine stellar parameters. 
    </p>

      I also explored the use of IRAF for data reduction and spectral analysis. This project not only deepened my 
      understanding of stellar astrophysics but also gave me hands-on exposure to observational planning, data reduction, 
      and interpretationâ€”an inspiring introduction to doing real science.
